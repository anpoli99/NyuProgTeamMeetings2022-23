I imagine it is hard to create a solution to this problem that does not involve DFSing the implicit tree;
notice that the number of flips for a child is the same as the number of parents we haven't added to our list
yet. We don't want to take a parent of a child with positive value first, but across children (or parents with
no "ready" children) with positive OR ZERO value, we need to find the lexicographically earliest in the tree.
We can both check if a vertex is ready to be removed and find the lexicographically earliest "ready" vertex
in one pass of a DFS on a tree.
