Here is the system for ICPC scoring:
You get one point for each problem.
Your penalty for that problem is (time that you solved it) + 20 * (wrong submissions for that problem)
There is no penalty for a problem you didn't solve!
Output the sum of scores and penalties for an ICPC team given their logs
